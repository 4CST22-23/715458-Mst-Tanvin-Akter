      <h3><u>Introducing of six season:</u></h3>
      <p>
        Although the number of seasons in most countries of the world is four,
        Bangladesh is a country of six seasons. Here a new season emerges every
        two months. The seasons are – Summer, Monsoon, Autumn, Winter, Winter
        and Spring. They rotate in cycles. And with the advent of every season,
        the nature and beauty of Bangladesh becomes diverse.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Summer</u></h3>
      <p>
        Summer comes at the beginning of the seasonal cycle. Baisakh-Jyashta is
        two months of summer. The arrival of summer to burn fields and fields
        with fire torches. Then the sky and air became dusty. Nature's
        green-smooth form is lost. Canals, rivers and canals dry up. In the
        unbearable heat, all animals yearn for a little cool water and shade.In
        the meantime, sometimes Kalbaisakhi's violent rampage starts suddenly.
        Everything breaks down. But summer does not only burn, but gives to
        unsparing hands nectar fruits like mango, jam, jackfruit, jamrul,
        litchi, watermelon and coconut.

        in torrents. The fields are filled with water. A pleasant liveliness
        appears in nature.Peace returns to public life. Farmers plant paddy-jute

        the night sky. The water in the bill sparkles with Shapla's smile. So
